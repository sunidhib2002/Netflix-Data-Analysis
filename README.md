<h4>Insights: </h4>
<ul>
<li>Netflix has more movies than TV shows. This tells that people prefer movies over web-series.</li>
<li>Among a set of countries(United States, India, South Africa, Mexico, Turkey, Spain, Italy, Brazil), most of the movies and TV shows are from Untied States. this shows that people globally prefer the content from US and enjoy watching that.</li>
<li>There are types of movies available on Netflix. Out of all those, drama and international movies are most popular. More such movies can increase the audience even more.</li>
<li>Poeple watch cult, thriller and drama movies for longer duration as compared to other categories.</li>
